# <Your-Project-Title>
prework study guide

## Description

This project's purpose was to help myself and others prepare for their coding bootcamp work.
The contents of the webpage include some basic facts about multiple aspects of coding in
HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It also gives basic info on managing the git flow. 

Through this project, I developed basic skills to create, launch, and debug basic programs.
